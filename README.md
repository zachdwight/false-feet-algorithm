# False Feet Algorithm (AKA Amoeba Algorithm)
## Novel Approach to Problem-Solving Through Inverse Resource Allocation

> *"When weak theories are given fair chances, convergence becomes a signal of robustness, not just luck."*

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

The **False Feet Algorithm** is a novel architecture for solving complex problems through **adaptive multi-branch reasoning** with **inverse resource allocation**. 

Instead of giving more resources to strong branches (traditional approach), this algorithm gives **more resources to weak branches** — forcing them to either improve or naturally die off. When multiple independent reasoning paths converge on the same answer despite starting with different hypotheses, that's a **very robust signal** of correctness.

The name comes from the biological metaphor: **amoebas use temporary "false feet" (pseudopodia) to explore and move.** These exploratory structures are not the final form — they're intermediate scaffolding that gets discarded. Similarly, this algorithm generates temporary reasoning branches that either converge to a solution or starve.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Mystery Solver (Original)

```bash
# Compile the mystery solver
make build

# Run (solves "The Vanished Necklace" mystery)
make run
```

**Output:** 4 investigative branches compete to solve a Hercule Poirot-style mystery. Converges in ~2 rounds. ✅

### Option 2: Generic Framework (New!)

```bash
# Compile the generic version
make generic

# Run (solves product recommendation problem)
make run-generic
```

**Output:** 4 evaluation branches compete to find the best product. Framework works for ANY hypothesis evaluation problem!

## 🔑 Core Innovation

```
TRADITIONAL SEARCH          FALSE FEET ALGORITHM
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
Strong branch               Weak branch
   ↓ (more resources)         ↓ (MORE resources)
Dominates                   Must prove itself or die
                           
Result: Single path         Result: Multiple converged
        (fragile)                   (robust)
```

### The Key Insight

In traditional algorithms:
- Strong candidates get more resources
- Single winner emerges
- Problem: If that winner is wrong, system fails

With False Feet Algorithm:
- Weak candidates get resources to catch up
- Multiple theories survive and explore differently
- All survivors see same evidence (shared pool)
- **When they converge, answer is very robust**

---

## 📊 How It Works (6 Phases Per Round)

```
PHASE A: Investigation
  └─ Each branch reasons using shared evidence pool

PHASE B: Evaluation  
  └─ Score each theory (likelihood of correctness)

PHASE C: Resource Allocation (INVERSE by rank)
  └─ Weakest branch → Most proposal slots
  └─ Strongest branch → Fewest slots

PHASE D: Evidence Gathering & Pooling
  └─ Branches propose new evidence/documents
  └─ Shared pool grows (budgeted, immutable)

PHASE E: Starvation & Culling
  └─ Branches with no improvement gradually starve
  └─ Proposal slots decrease each round
  └─ When slots = 0, branch dies naturally

CONVERGENCE CHECK
  └─ Do all survivors agree on answer?
  └─ YES → SOLVED (with high confidence)
  └─ NO → Repeat until convergence or timeout
```

## 🎯 Using the Generic Framework

**The generic framework is domain-agnostic and ready to use for any hypothesis evaluation problem!**

### How It Works

Replace mystery-specific concepts with your own:

| Mystery | Generic | Your Domain |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Evidence | DataPoint | Requirement, Feature, Symptom |
| Suspect | Option | Product, Diagnosis, Recipe |
| Investigation | Evaluation | Analysis, Assessment |

### Quick Example: Product Recommendation

```cpp
// Define your problem
Problem problem;
problem.title = "Best Product for Customer";
problem.goal = "Find optimal product given constraints";

// Add options to evaluate
problem.options = {
    Option{"product_a", "Premium Pro", "For power users", "top-tier quality", 50},
    Option{"product_b", "Budget Basic", "For cost-conscious", "affordable", 40}
};

// Add data points that support/contradict options
problem.all_data.push_back(DataPoint{
    "data_1",
    "Customer needs portability",
    "Lightweight is critical",
    {"product_b"},        // supports lightweight product
    {"product_a"},        // contradicts heavy premium product
    5                     // priority
});

// Run the algorithm
AmoebaInvestigation solver(problem);
solver.solve();
```

All 4 evaluation branches compete, share data, and converge on best product! ✅

### Other Examples Included

See `src/generic_main.cpp` for:
- **Product Recommendation** — Find best product for customer needs
- **Medical Diagnosis** — Identify most likely diagnosis from symptoms

### Create Your Own

1. Define your `Option` candidates
2. Define your `DataPoint` evidence/requirements
3. Create a `Problem` with them
4. Run `AmoebaInvestigation solver(problem); solver.solve();`

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change the Mystery
Edit `setup_mystery()` in `src/poirot_main.cpp`:
```cpp
mystery.suspects.push_back(Suspect{
  "id", "Name", "Motive", "Opportunity"
});

mystery.all_evidence.push_back(Evidence{
  "id", "Title", "Description",
  {"incriminates_id"}, {"exonerates_id"}, priority
});
```

### Change Algorithm Parameters
Edit `MysteryInvestigation` in `src/poirot_solver.h`:
```cpp
max_iterations = 20;              // More rounds
pool_budget = 50;                 // Larger pool
proposal_budget_per_round = 10;   // More proposals
improvement_threshold = 0.01;     // Stricter
starvation_rounds = 5;            // Longer grace period
```

### Change Evaluator Scoring
Modify `MysteryEvaluator` in `src/poirot_mystery.h`:
```cpp
float evaluate_evidence_support() { ... }
float evaluate_motive() { ... }
float evaluate_consistency() { ... }
```

---

## 📚 Apply to Other Domains

The algorithm is **domain-agnostic**. Examples:

### Recipe/Meal Planner
- **Evidence:** Ingredients, nutrition facts, preparation time
- **Branches:** Different meal theories
- **Convergence:** "This recipe works best given constraints"

### Product Recommender
- **Evidence:** Product features, user requirements, reviews
- **Branches:** Different product theories
- **Convergence:** "This product best fits your needs"

### QA/Retrieval System
- **Evidence:** Document relevance, semantic similarity
- **Branches:** Different answer hypotheses
- **Convergence:** "This answer is most correct"

---

## 🧠 Training (Self-Supervised)

The formal specification includes a complete training procedure:

### Phase 0: Warm Start
Use hand-crafted heuristic evaluator
```
score = 0.5 * coherence(τ) 
      + 0.3 * relevance(τ, q)
      + 0.2 * consistency(τ, 𝒫)
```

### Phase 1: Self-Supervised Learning
Run tree search on (query, correct_answer) pairs. Loss:
```
LOSS = -log(score_of_correct_survivors)
     + log(score_of_incorrect_survivors)
     + penalty_for_wasted_branches

Backprop through entire search to refine evaluator
```

See [`docs/amoeba_algorithm_spec.md`](docs/amoeba_algorithm_spec.md) Section 4 for complete procedure.
